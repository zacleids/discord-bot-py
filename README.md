### Running discord-bot

In order to run the discord bot, you need a .env file with the `DISCORD_TOKEN` filled out. You can copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your bot token that has access to a discord server of your choice.

Once the `DISCORD_TOKEN` has been added, you can run the bot with
```sh
python bot.py
```
